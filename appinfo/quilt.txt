quilt cheat-sheet (with OE/Yocto's '-c devshell')
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

to create a new patch:
---------------------
$ quilt new <patch name>
$ quilt add <filenames which are part of patch>
(edit files, listed in filenames above)
$ quilt refresh

NOTE: that you /have/ to "quilt add" the filenames *before* you edit them,
      otherwise quilt doesn't notice that they've changed

      in my opinion it is sad this is how quilt has to work since it is not
      always possible to know ahead of time which files need to be part of a
      particular patch. sometimes when you're jumping around from file to file
      (using tags, for example) you'll need to keep track of which files you
      visited and changed and be sure to "quilt add" them before you make any
      changes


to modify an existing patch:
---------------------------
as an amazing feature, OE/Yocto uses quilt when applying a recipe's patches.
therefore when you "bitbake -c devshell <recipe>" you'll end up at a prompt,
ready to go, with all the patches already applied and placed in a series for
quilt to use

therefore, if you need to edit/update a patch somewhere in the series you can
back up the patches, make the change, and re-apply the remaining patches;
in order

for example, let's say a recipe applies the following patches (in order):
	A.patch
	B.patch
	C.patch
	D.patch
	E.patch
	F.patch

if you do:
	$ bitbake -c devshell recipe
when you get to a prompt:
	$ quilt series
	A.patch
	B.patch
	C.patch
	D.patch
	E.patch
	F.patch

if you want to modify C.patch simply:
	$ quilt pop patches/C.patch
	(note modify any files you want, if the file you're modifying is
	already part of C.patch then you don't have to do anything other than
	modify the file, if you want to add more files to the patch you have
	to remember to "quilt add" them first)
	$ quilt refresh
	$ quilt pop -a

from the previous steps, the "pop" will unapply patches F.patch, E.patch, and
D.patch. you can then make any modifications you want to C.patch and then
refresh quilt so that any changes you have made will now be part of C.patch.
then you can re-apply the remaining patches by popping "all" of them.
