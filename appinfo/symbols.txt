to type special symbols you need a compose key
by default (or at least in my case) the compose key sequence is:
	shift + right ctrl

(see the file /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose for more)

british pound symbol:
	xchat:
		left ctrl + left shift + u + a + 3
		(hold ctrl + shift while typing u a 3)
	xterm:
		compose + l + -

euro symbol:
	xchat:
		compose + e + =
	xterm:
		unfortunately the default iso-5589-1 font doesn't include the euro symbol
		you need to switch to something ending in iso8859-15
			$ xlsfonts -fn '*-iso8859-15'
			  (select a font)
			look at the font with:
			$ xfd -fn <font name>
			use font with:
			$ xterm -fn <font name>
		now you can use the following to get the euro symbol:
			compose + x + o
