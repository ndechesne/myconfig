to build gnu radio follow the instructions here:
	http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/BuildGuide

after performing the "cmake" command, you'll probably want to review
the list of what was found and what wasn't and try to install the
related "-devel" pacakges.

note that UHD and SHD are drivers for specific hardware devices; neither
are really required, i couldn't get shd to be found, their sources can be
found at:
	SHD: git://github.com/symplex/shd
	UHD: git://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd.git

openSUSE doesn't provide any packages for comedilib:
	git://comedi.org/git/comedi/comedilib.git



after building, when i tried to run i got a dialog box saying something
was wrong (cannot import gnuradio) and asking me if i had properly setup
PYTHONPATH and a bunch of other env vars. so i tried running it "by hand":

	python
	>>> from gnuradio import gr
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
	  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnuradio/gr/__init__.py", line 43, in <module>
	    from gnuradio_core import *
	  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnuradio/gr/gnuradio_core.py", line 23, in <module>
	    from gnuradio_core_runtime import *
	  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnuradio/gr/gnuradio_core_runtime.py", line 26, in <module>
	    _gnuradio_core_runtime = swig_import_helper()
	  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnuradio/gr/gnuradio_core_runtime.py", line 22, in swig_import_helper
	    _mod = imp.load_module('_gnuradio_core_runtime', fp, pathname, description)
	ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (init_gnuradio_core_runtime)

the solution is to be found here:
	https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=147452

the problem is that my system includes both python2 and python3,
coincidentally it builds against python3 but tries to run with python2

solution:
	1) remove python3

	2) run configure as follows:
		cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python2.7 \
		-DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python2.7 \
		-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so \
		...


other good configure line items are:
	-DQWT_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include/qwt5
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/trevor/local/packages/gnuradio-git
